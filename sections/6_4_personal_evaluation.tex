\section{Personal Evaluation}\label{sec:personal-evaluation}
By doing this project, I learned a new way-of-working and I improved my knowledge in various topics and fields.
I think this is very educational, and it introduced me into the world of research, letting me know that not every trial is successful, and that it is necessary to be meticulous and to have a lot of patience if you want to achieve good results.
I also learned that it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the topic, and to have a solid background, to do a lot of researches and to read a lot of papers, to understand the problem and to find the best solution.

It has been an interesting experience, and I think that I have learned a lot, improving my abilities to work with neural networks, to fix their problem and to see the results in a critical way.

Finally, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.~Luigi Di Stefano and my co-supervisor, Luca De Luigi for being so helpful and patient to help me to complete this project.
Without their help, I would not have been able to complete this project.
