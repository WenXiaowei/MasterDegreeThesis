\section{Deep Learning}\label{sec:deep-learning}


A deep neural network is composed mainly by the neural network, the optimizer, the loss function, meanwhile, there are also other components, like learning rate lr scheduler, which can change the value of the learning rate during the training based on the value of the loss function.

The Neural network can be composed by different layers, e.g., the dense layer, the convolutional layer, the pooling layer, the layers between the first and the last are called hidden layers.
After each layer, there is the activation function, for example can be: relu, gelu, selu, leakyRelu,  % esempi con le activation funcitons.
