\subsection{Full sequence prediction}\label{subsec:full-sequence-prediction}
The different models we achieved different results, but the most important result is that we settled down an important baseline for the future development of this system.
After a few trials with few models, which produced some circular trajectories, we achieved
The encoder-only version of transformer, and feeding the \textit{sequence 3} of Kitti (for more details \S~\ref{sec:kitti}) where the first image is considered as origin, we showed that the model is able to learn a single sequence in overfitting, but fails when trying to overfit a more complex sequence.

The encoder-decoder version we achieved the same results as the previous version, but the model was able to learn the also the \textit{sequence 7} of Kitti, but it fails when we train the model with both \textit{sequence 3} and \textit{sequence 7}.

\subsection{Autoregressive models}\label{subsec:autoregressive-model}
We implemented only the encoder-decoder version of the transformer in the autoregressive way, and most of the time the prediction of the network during the training on seq 3 is just a straight line.
So the model is \textbf{not} able to predict the simplest sequence in overfitting.
The model could not predict any reasonable trajectory, predicting only a linear trajectory as the follow:

\end{figure}
Although after more than one hundred epochs of training, the network cannot understand the goal, this could be caused by the loss used.
