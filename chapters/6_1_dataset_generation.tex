\section{Dataset preprocessing}\label{sec:dataset-preprocessing}

Before feeding the image into the transformer, we preprocessed the images, as is usual in the literature, we computed the mean and the standard deviation per colour of the datesets, then we performed a normalization of the images.

Originally the RGB values are [zero, 255], we make a normalization dividing all values by 255, bringing the range of possible values to [zero, 1], this helps the neural network because it reducing the value range ... %todo
